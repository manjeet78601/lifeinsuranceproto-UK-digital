                EXP_BODY: `<p>Term life insurance a popular form of life insurance.
       You can buy life insurance that will last anywhere between 1-30 years.
       If you pass away before the policy has expired, your beneficiaries will
       be paid out the death benefit. If you wish to continue having life insurance
       after the policy expires, you could either renew your policy or switch
       providers entirely, at a new higher age adjusted premium rate. It is also
       important to keep in mind that some policies have a 10-year policy cap restriction
       past the age of 50.</p>
       <p>Term life insurance is a more affordable option than other forms of insurance
       because of its fixed time. It is suitable if you are looking to protect dependents
       for a limited period of time.</p>
       <p>Term life insurance is an appropriate option if you are not seeking a savings
       component and would like straight-forward protection at a lower premium.</p>`,

                EXP_BODY: `<p>Permanent life insurance provides you with lifelong
    protection as long as you pay your set premium every month. Each time you pay
    the monthly premium, a portion goes to your death benefit and a portion is set aside
    to your cash value account. The cash value functions as a savings account. When you pass
    away, your family will receive the full un-taxed death benefit. Even though permanent life
    insurance guarantees coverage for life, it is less popular because it is more expensive
    than term life insurance.</p><p>The advantage of a cash value component is the option
    to use that money for personal expenses or take a loan from that amount. If you withdraw,
    that money may be taxed, and if you take out a loan, that amount will be deducted from the
    death benefit if the loan is not paid back.</p><p>If you have living dependents, are looking
     to build a tax-advantaged inheritance and/or have outlived your term life policy,
     permanent life insurance may be for you.</p>`

                EXP_BODY: `<p>Like permanent life insurance, variable life insurance provides
    lifelong coverage, and the premium consists of contributions for the death benefit
    and cash value. In the case of variable life insurance, the cash value operates similar
    to a mutual fund. The cash value is invested by professional fund managers; over time
    the cash value will fluctuate based on your investment options. The cash invested grows
    tax-free. However, if you withdraw from the cash value, you may incur taxes and fees.</p>
    <p>Variable life insurance is suitable for those seeking an additional investment
    component in addition to life insurance.</p>`

    insurance of Life+ provides you term life insurance, plus an option to save money that
    will stay with you even after your term expires. If you pass away before the term expires,
    the cash value will be dispersed to your beneficiaries in addition to the term life
    policy. If you pass away after the term expires, the cash value will be dispersed
    but you will not be paid any amount from the term life policy. That way, you have
    some financial safety for end of life expenses.</p><p>Similar to permanent life
    insurance, you have the option to contribute to your cash value every month, and
    you have the flexibility to decide how much to contribute every month. That way,
    you are not subject to the exorbitant prices of permanent life insurance.</p>
    <p>At Life+, you will not have access to the cash value. It will only be dispersed
    at the time of your passing, or upon the term expiration (whichever comes first).</p>`
